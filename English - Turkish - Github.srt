1
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:46,933
Size William
Wallace'ı anlatacağım.

2
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:50,436
İngiliz tarihçiler benim bir
yalancı olduğumu söyleyecek.

3
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:54,600
Çünkü tarihi, kahramanları darağacında
sallandıranlar yazar.

4
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:59,116
İskoçya kralı öldüğünde, 
bir oğlu yoktu,

5
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:04,754
ve İngiltere Kralı; Uzunbacaklı Edward 
olarak tanınan zalim bir pagan,

6
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:08,358
kendini İskoçya Kralı 
ilan etti.

7
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:14,330
İskoçya soyluları taht için hem kralla, 
hem de kendi aralarında savaştılar.

8
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:18,702
Hal böyleyken Uzun bacaklı Edward, iskoç soylulara, 
ateşkes toplantısı yapmak üzere onlara bir davet yolladı.

9
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,904
Silahsız bir toplantı olacaktı.
Sadece belgeler imzalanarak.

10
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:18,131
So Longshanks invited them
to talks of truce...

11
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:21,498
no weapons,
one page only.

12
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,101
Among the farmers of that shire
was Malcolm Wallace,

13
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:31,439
a commoner
with his own lands.

14
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,946
He had two sons...
John and William.

15
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:42,189
I told you to stay.

16
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:45,157
Well,
I finished my work.

17
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,125
Where are we going?

18
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,163
MacAndrews'.
He was supposed to visit

19
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:50,424
when the gathering
was over.

20
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:52,533
- Can I come?
- No, go home, boy.

21
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,100
But I want to go.

22
00:02:54,202 --> 00:02:56,295
Go home or you'll feel
the back of my hand.

23
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:58,463
Go you home,
William.

24
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:24,130
MacAndrews!

25
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:30,670
MacAndrews!

26
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:41,448
Holy Jesus.

27
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:25,190
Aah!

28
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:27,523
It's all right!

29
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:29,687
William!

30
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,731
William!
William, it's all right.

31
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,131
It's all right.
Easy, lad.

32
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:52,280
William.

33
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,614
Uhh!

34
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:56,656
And I say
we hit back now!

35
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:59,693
We cannot fight them!
It's suicide!

36
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:02,957
Wallace is right!
We fight them!

37
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,794
Every nobleman who had
a will to fight

38
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,697
was at that meeting.

39
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:09,064
We cannot beat
an army.

40
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:10,569
Not with 50 farmers.

41
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:13,106
We do not have
to beat them, just fight them.

42
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,641
Now, who's with me?

43
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,767
I am, Wallace.

44
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:18,344
All right, all right.

45
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:19,470
Ready.

46
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,129
Where do you think
you're going?

47
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:37,630
I'm going with you.

48
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:39,632
Ah, you're going
with me, are you?

49
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:42,134
And what are you
going to do?

50
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:43,636
I'm going to help.

51
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:46,138
Hey, and a good help
you'd be, too,

52
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:49,142
but I need you
to stay here

53
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:52,145
and look
after the place for me

54
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:53,646
while I'm away.

55
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:55,181
I can fight.

56
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,944
I know.

57
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:01,715
I know
you can fight.

58
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:09,496
But it's our wits
that make us men.

59
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:15,333
See you tomorrow.

60
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:18,229
Ha!

61
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:44,963
Hiya!

62
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:47,660
English.

63
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:50,134
Get down.

64
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:52,263
With your father
and brother gone,

65
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:55,103
they'll kill us
and burn the farm.

66
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:56,642
It's up to us, Hamish.

67
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,921
Nah.

68
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:19,899
Uhh!

69
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,726
Uhh. Ahh.

70
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:03,008
Da?

71
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:10,982
Da?

72
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:24,682
William.

73
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:29,596
Come here, lad.

74
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:01,951
Amen.

75
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:03,216
Amen.

76
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,399
William.

77
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:03,175
I'm your uncle.
Argyle.

78
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,683
You have the look
of your mother.

79
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:25,030
Mmm.

80
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:30,970
We'll stay here tonight.

81
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:33,506
Tomorrow you'll
come home with me.

82
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,074
I don't want to leave.

83
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:38,873
You didn't want your father
to die either, did you?

84
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,346
But it happened.

85
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:48,554
Did the priest give
a poetic benediction?

86
00:13:48,656 --> 00:13:50,886
"The Lord bless thee
and keep thee"?

87
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:54,018
It was in Latin.

88
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:55,561
You don't speak Latin?

89
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:58,826
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

90
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:06,505
The Lord
bless thee and keep thee.

91
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:10,008
The Lord cause His light
to shine on thee.

92
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:13,877
The Lord lift up
His countenance upon thee

93
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:15,948
and give thee peace.

94
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,608
Amen.

95
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:27,118
Your heart is free.

96
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:30,129
Have the courage
to follow it.

97
00:14:57,091 --> 00:14:58,991
What are they doing?

98
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:02,927
Saying good-bye
in their own way...

99
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,466
playing outlawed tunes
on outlawed pipes.

100
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,111
It was the same for me
and your daddy

101
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:21,204
when our father
was killed.

102
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:52,535
First, learn to use...

103
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:53,614
this.

104
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:57,548
Then I'll teach you
to use...

105
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:59,210
this.

106
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,449
Many years later,

107
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:33,452
Edward the Longshanks,
King of England,

108
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:36,455
supervised the wedding
of his eldest son,

109
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:39,458
who would succeed him
to the throne.

110
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:42,790
Amen.

111
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:49,468
Asbride for his son,

112
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,267
Longshanks had chosen
the daughter of his rival,

113
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:54,966
the king of France.

114
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:22,059
It was widely whispered that
for the princess to conceive,

115
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:25,468
Longshanks would have to do
the honors himself.

116
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:29,942
That may have been
what he had in mind all along.

117
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:38,110
Scotland... my land.

118
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:44,616
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength,

119
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:46,818
but how will they
believe our strength

120
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:49,953
when we cannot rule
the whole of our own island?

121
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:02,874
Where is my son?

122
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:04,410
Your pardon, milord.

123
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:07,037
He asked me
to come in his stead.

124
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:10,447
I sent for him,
and he sends you.

125
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:12,246
Shall I leave, milord?

126
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:16,915
If he wants his queen
to rule when I am gone,

127
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:20,425
then, by all means,
stay and learn how.

128
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:21,426
Please.

129
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,425
Nobles.

130
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:31,733
Nobles are the key
to the door of Scotland.

131
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,433
Grant our nobles
lands in the north,

132
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:38,945
give their nobles
estates here in England,

133
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:41,446
and make them too greedy
to oppose us.

134
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:44,450
But, sire, our nobles
will be reluctant to uproot.

135
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:46,452
New lands
mean new taxes,

136
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:49,455
and they're already taxed
for the war in France.

137
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:51,457
Are they?

138
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,459
Are they?

139
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:16,711
The trouble with Scotland
is that it's full of Scots.

140
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:22,921
Perhaps the time has come

141
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:25,924
to reinstitute
an old custom.

142
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:29,723
Grant them prima noctes.

143
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:33,329
First night.

144
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:36,961
When any common girl inhabiting
their lands is married,

145
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:41,064
our nobles shall have
sexual rights to her

146
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:43,973
on the night
of her wedding.

147
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:50,983
If we cart get them out,
we'll breed them out.



148
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:54,486
That should fetch
just the kind of lords

149
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:56,419
we want to Scotland,

150
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,491
taxes or no taxes, huh?

151
00:19:58,592 --> 00:20:00,492
A most excellent
idea, sire.

152
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:01,993
Is it?

153
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:11,500
Now in Edinburgh gathered
the council of Scottish nobles.

154
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:16,008
Among these was Robert
the 17th earl of Bruce,

155
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,308
the leading contender
for the crown of Scotland.

156
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:29,021
Ah, I hear that Longshanks
has granted prima noctes.

157
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:32,957
Clearly meant to draw more
of his supporters here.

158
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,528
My father believes
that we must

159
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:38,530
lull Longshanks
into our confidence

160
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:41,032
by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

161
00:20:41,135 --> 00:20:42,534
A wise plan.

162
00:20:42,636 --> 00:20:46,037
And how is your father?
We missed him at the council.

163
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,904
His affairs in France
keep him long overdue.


ve benim tüm Bruce'lari temsil ettigimi söyledi
ve ayrica Iskoçyayi.

164
00:20:52,646 --> 00:20:54,546
But he sends his greetings,

165
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:58,880
and he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces


166
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:00,317
and for Scotland.

167
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,983
Ah, it's
all over now.

168
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:14,054
You've dropped
your rock.

169
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:15,519
Test of manhood.

170
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:18,991
You win.

171
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:20,219
Ah.

172
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:23,490
Call it a test
of soldiery, then.

173
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:25,997
The English won't let us
train with weapons,

174
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,567
so we train with stones.

175
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:31,468
The test of a soldier
is not in his arm.

176
00:23:31,572 --> 00:23:32,834
It's here.

177
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,101
No. It's here.

178
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:39,239
Ha ha!

179
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:41,405
Hamish?

180
00:23:41,515 --> 00:23:43,380
Mm-hmm.

181
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:56,986
Here you go, son.

182
00:23:57,097 --> 00:23:58,064
Show him how.

183
00:23:58,165 --> 00:23:59,291
Come on, Hamish!

184
00:24:14,615 --> 00:24:17,175
Ha ha ha ha!
My boy!

185
00:24:17,284 --> 00:24:18,979
That was a good throw.

186
00:24:19,086 --> 00:24:21,452
Aye. Aye, it was.

187
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:26,322
I was wondering if you could
do that when it matters.

188
00:24:26,426 --> 00:24:29,918
As it...
As it matters in battle.

189
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:33,859
Could you crush a man
with that throw?

190
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:37,232
I could crush you
like a worm.

191
00:24:37,337 --> 00:24:38,998
Ooh!

192
00:24:39,106 --> 00:24:40,698
You could?

193
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:41,705
Aye.

194
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:43,332
Well, then do it.

195
00:24:43,443 --> 00:24:46,776
Would you like to see him
crush me like a worm?

196
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,715
Come do it.

197
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:52,546
You'll move.

198
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:54,518
I will not.

199
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:56,020
Right.

200
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,215
He'll move.

201
00:24:57,324 --> 00:24:59,292
Come on, Hamish.

202
00:24:59,393 --> 00:25:01,588
Come on there,
boy!

203
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:11,895
Well done!

204
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:20,537
Ah!

205
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:27,517
Fine display,
young Wallace.

206
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:29,179
Are you all right?

207
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:31,985
You look
a wee bit shaky.

208
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:34,287
I should have remembered
the rocks.

209
00:25:34,394 --> 00:25:35,326
Aye, you should have.

210
00:25:40,534 --> 00:25:43,264
Get up, you big heap.

211
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,998
It's good
to see you again.

212
00:25:46,106 --> 00:25:47,903
Aye. Welcome home.

213
00:25:48,008 --> 00:25:49,999
Oh, me head.

214
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,010
Oh, you should
have moved.

215
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:04,785
William...

216
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:06,449
will you dance
with me?

217
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,959
Of course I will.

218
00:26:33,587 --> 00:26:36,988
I've come to claim
the right of prima noctes.

219
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,490
As lord of these lands,

220
00:26:39,593 --> 00:26:40,992
I will
bless this marriage

221
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:43,324
by taking the bride
into my bed

222
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,024
on the first night
of her union.

223
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:47,896
Oh, by God,
you will not!

224
00:26:51,071 --> 00:26:53,767
It is my noble right.

225
00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:56,961
Good evening, sin'.

226
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:58,963
Ah, young Wallace.

227
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:00,930
Grand soft evening, huh?

228
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,399
Aye, it's that.

229
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:06,233
I was wondering if I might have
a word with your daughter.

230
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:09,103
What do you want
to have a word about?

231
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,109
Well, um...

232
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:14,738
Murron, would you like
to come and ride with me

233
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:16,839
on this fine evening?

234
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,044
In this?
You're out of your mind.

235
00:29:20,153 --> 00:29:21,313
It's good
Scottish weather, madame.

236
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:23,412
The rain is falling
straight down.

237
00:29:23,523 --> 00:29:25,320
Well, slightly
to the side, like.

238
00:29:25,425 --> 00:29:27,154
She cart go with you.

239
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,694
No the now, anyway.

240
00:29:29,796 --> 00:29:30,854
No the now.

241
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:33,057
- No the now?
- We'll see you later.

242
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:35,930
The weather's just fine.
It's hardly raining.

243
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:37,970
Did you not hear
what I said?

244
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:40,699
Murron! Get... Oh.

245
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:44,601
It's you she takes after.

246
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:16,440
How could you know me
after so long?

247
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:17,976
Well, I didn't.

248
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:21,309
I saw you staring,
and I didn't know who you were.

249
00:30:21,414 --> 00:30:23,974
I'm sorry.
I suppose I was.

250
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:26,984
Are you in the habit

251
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:29,146
of riding off in the rain
with strangers?

252
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:32,487
It was the best way
to make you leave.

253
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:37,986
Well, if I can ever work up
the courage to ask you again,

254
00:30:38,098 --> 00:30:39,565
I'll send
written warning first.

255
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,258
Wouldn't do much good.
I cart read.

256
00:30:41,368 --> 00:30:43,336
Can you not?

257
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:44,494
No.

258
00:30:44,604 --> 00:30:46,003
Well, that's something

259
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:48,631
we shall have to remedy,
isn't it?

260
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:51,506
You're going to
teach me to read, then?

261
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:52,737
If you like.

262
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,711
In what language?

263
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:57,977
You're showing off now.

264
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:00,018
That's right.
Are you impressed yet?

265
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,212
No. Why should I be?

266
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:12,031
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.

267
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:15,260
My kilt will fly up,
but I'll try it.

268
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:17,700
God, you certainly
didn't learn any manners.

269
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:20,034
The French and Romans
have far worse manners.

270
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,471
You've been to Rome?

271
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:22,974
Aye. Argyle took me
on a pilgrimage.

272
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:24,668
What was it like?

273
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:31,782
What does that mean?

274
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:33,876
Beautiful.

275
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:39,187
But I belong here.

276
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:13,491
Murron?

277
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:14,958
Come in now.

278
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:27,127
Sin', I know it was
strange of me

279
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:29,292
to invite Murron
to ride last night,

280
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:30,460
but I assure you...

281
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,004
Mac Clannough's daughter
is another matter.

282
00:33:33,106 --> 00:33:35,631
I've come to fetch you
to our meeting.

283
00:33:35,742 --> 00:33:37,539
What kind
of meeting?

284
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:39,271
The secret kind.

285
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:41,973
Your meetings are
a waste of time, Campbell.

286
00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:47,486
Your father was a fighter
and a patriot.

287
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:51,353
I know
who my father was.

288
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:54,484
I came back home
to raise crops

289
00:33:54,594 --> 00:33:56,459
and, God willing,
a family.

290
00:33:56,563 --> 00:34:00,055
If I can live
in peace, I will.

291
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:01,599
Go on.

292
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:04,397
You say you want
to stay out of the troubles?

293
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:07,439
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

294
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,804
Until you prove it,
my answer's no.

295
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,240
No?

296
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:12,936
No, Wallace. No.

297
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:14,673
Didn't I just prove it?

298
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:15,839
No!

299
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:16,938
No?

300
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,278
No!

301
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:45,635
Uh!

302
00:34:59,092 --> 00:35:02,425
Of course, running a farm's
a lot of work,

303
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:05,930
but that will all change
when my sons arrive.

304
00:35:06,032 --> 00:35:07,397
So you've
got children?

305
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,934
Oh, not yet,
but I was hoping

306
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:12,334
that you could
help me with that.

307
00:35:12,438 --> 00:35:14,906
So you want me
to marry you, then?

308
00:35:15,008 --> 00:35:17,533
Well, it's a bit sudden,
but all right.

309
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:19,544
Is that what you call
a proposal?

310
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:24,083
I love you.
Always have.

311
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,687
I want to marry you.

312
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,465
Is that a "yes"?

313
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:42,967
Aye, that's a "yes. "

314
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:44,127
It is?

315
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:28,912
We best hurry.
He'll be waiting.

316
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:30,073
Oh, wait.

317
00:36:30,183 --> 00:36:31,411
Where are you going?

318
00:36:37,523 --> 00:36:38,421
What's that?

319
00:36:38,524 --> 00:36:39,752
You'll see.

320
00:36:58,544 --> 00:36:59,875
Father.

321
00:37:12,558 --> 00:37:15,891
I will love you
my whole life,

322
00:37:15,995 --> 00:37:17,929
you and no other.

323
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:25,397
And I you,

324
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:28,030
you and no other,
forever.

325
00:40:56,682 --> 00:40:59,116
When am I going
to see you again?

326
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:00,150
Tonight?

327
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:01,151
I cart.

328
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:02,152
Why not?

329
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:03,654
My dad's growin'
suspicious.

330
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:05,155
Growin' suspicious,
is he?

331
00:41:05,258 --> 00:41:07,658
Wouldn't have anything
to do with that.

332
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,159
When? When? When?

333
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:10,160
When?

334
00:41:10,263 --> 00:41:11,161
Tonight.

335
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:12,162
Tonight.

336
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:13,323
Tonight.

337
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,307
Look lively,
Sergeant.

338
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:35,686
Where are you
going, lassie?

339
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:37,187
Ooh, that
looks heavy.

340
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,190
Let me help you
with it.

341
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:40,691
No. It's fine.

342
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:43,193
I'm not going
to steal it.

343
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:46,129
Oh, you remind me
of my daughter back home.

344
00:41:59,745 --> 00:42:00,973
Hello, lassie.

345
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,657
Aah!

346
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,660
No!

347
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:18,389
Shh! Shh!

348
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,466
Keep it quiet, Smythe.

349
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:25,503
Ah!

350
00:42:25,638 --> 00:42:27,299
You bitch!

351
00:42:27,406 --> 00:42:28,668
Aah!

352
00:42:28,774 --> 00:42:31,140
Aah!

353
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:36,712
Aah! You...

354
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:38,181
bitch!

355
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,690
Are you all right?

356
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:48,657
All right?
Come on.

357
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:52,162
Are you all right?

358
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:53,095
Aye.

359
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,564
Are you all right?

360
00:43:02,308 --> 00:43:04,105
Can you ride?

361
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,108
Aye.

362
00:43:10,082 --> 00:43:12,778
Come back here,
you bastard!

363
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:14,648
Raise the alarm!

364
00:43:14,754 --> 00:43:16,119
Help!

365
00:43:16,222 --> 00:43:18,452
Meet me
at the grove.

366
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:19,649
Ride!

367
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:21,590
They're
getting away!

368
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:29,201
Go round back!

369
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:46,810
Get him!

370
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:49,217
Come on!

371
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:01,431
Ah!

372
00:44:29,228 --> 00:44:30,627
Murron?

373
00:44:38,237 --> 00:44:39,636
Murron!

374
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:50,647
All of you know
full well

375
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,378
the great pains
I've always taken

376
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:56,580
never to be too strict,
too rigid

377
00:44:56,689 --> 00:45:00,147
with the application
of our laws,

378
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:01,783
and as a consequence,

379
00:45:01,894 --> 00:45:05,091
have we not learned
to live together

380
00:45:05,197 --> 00:45:07,665
in relative peace
and harmony?

381
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:09,530
Huh?

382
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:15,605
And this day's lawlessness

383
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:19,109
is how you repay
my leniency!

384
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,314
Well, you leave me
with little choice.

385
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:40,158
An assault
on the king's soldiers...

386
00:45:42,101 --> 00:45:46,936
is the same as an assault
on the king himself.

387
00:46:01,187 --> 00:46:03,087
Now...

388
00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:06,522
Let this scrapper
come to me.

389
00:46:52,571 --> 00:46:54,562
Sin'!

390
00:47:02,414 --> 00:47:04,075
There.

391
00:49:30,462 --> 00:49:31,928
Aah!

392
00:49:44,343 --> 00:49:46,038
Aah!

393
00:49:46,145 --> 00:49:49,581
Argh!

394
00:49:49,682 --> 00:49:51,707
Ahh!

395
00:50:29,955 --> 00:50:31,115
Corporal.

396
00:50:31,223 --> 00:50:32,986
Some archers
on the tower now!

397
00:50:39,865 --> 00:50:42,026
Ah! Aah...

398
00:50:43,602 --> 00:50:44,796
Hold still.

399
00:50:44,903 --> 00:50:46,131
Aah!

400
00:50:46,238 --> 00:50:48,172
You idiot boy!

401
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:05,087
Aah!

402
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:08,588
Argh!

403
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:11,956
Aah!

404
00:51:21,473 --> 00:51:23,031
Unh!

405
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:26,475
Unh!

406
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:14,090
Father,
how are you?

407
00:52:14,193 --> 00:52:16,024
Unh.

408
00:53:37,209 --> 00:53:39,609
Macaulish.

409
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,111
Macaulish.

410
00:53:44,216 --> 00:53:46,081
Macaulish!

411
00:53:47,486 --> 00:53:50,421
Macaulish! Macaulish!

412
00:53:57,229 --> 00:54:00,062
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

413
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:20,934
What you waiting
for, boy?

414
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:25,074
Here. You can do it.

415
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:27,077
I'll hold him down.

416
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:29,079
Here.
You can do it.

417
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:30,978
I'll hold him down.

418
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,074
Pour it straight
in the wound.

419
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:36,211
It seems like a waste
of good whiskey.

420
00:56:36,321 --> 00:56:38,482
Indulge me. Ah!

421
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,057
Aah!

422
00:56:40,158 --> 00:56:41,455
Hold him.
Hold him.

423
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,960
Hold him.

424
00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:45,620
Now let him go.

425
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,129
Aah!

426
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:49,097
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

427
00:56:51,203 --> 00:56:54,536
That'll wake you up
in the morning, boy.

428
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:56,402
There's somebody coming!

429
00:56:56,508 --> 00:56:58,203
Arm yourselves!

430
00:57:03,982 --> 00:57:06,507
There's somebody coming.

431
00:57:06,618 --> 00:57:09,553
MacGregors...
from the next clan.

432
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:17,059
We heard about
what was happening.

433
00:57:17,162 --> 00:57:19,062
We don't want
you amadans

434
00:57:19,164 --> 00:57:22,031
thinking you can
have your fun without us.

435
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:24,329
Go home.

436
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:28,069
Some of us
are in this.

437
00:57:28,173 --> 00:57:30,073
Cart help that now.

438
00:57:30,175 --> 00:57:32,666
But you can help
yourselves.

439
00:57:32,777 --> 00:57:33,744
Go home.

440
00:57:33,845 --> 00:57:35,244
We'll have
no homes left

441
00:57:35,347 --> 00:57:37,542
when the English garrison
from the castle

442
00:57:37,649 --> 00:57:39,708
comes through
and burns us out.

443
00:57:39,818 --> 00:57:41,911
And they will.

444
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:46,451
Welcome.

445
00:58:15,654 --> 00:58:17,554
Patrol returning,
milord!

446
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,548
So what news?

447
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:01,531
I have dispatched
100 soldiers to Lanark.

448
00:59:01,633 --> 00:59:03,567
They will be
returning now!

449
00:59:03,668 --> 00:59:05,761
What, are they
dressed like this?

450
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:10,038
Actually,
it was more like 50.

451
00:59:10,141 --> 00:59:11,540
Make it quick.

452
00:59:14,145 --> 00:59:15,544
You remember me?

453
00:59:15,647 --> 00:59:18,377
I never did her
any harm.

454
00:59:18,483 --> 00:59:19,882
It was my right.

455
00:59:19,985 --> 00:59:21,043
Your right?

456
00:59:21,152 --> 00:59:23,916
I'm here to claim the right
of a husband!

457
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:26,456
Ah!

458
00:59:30,662 --> 00:59:32,562
I am William Wallace.

459
00:59:34,165 --> 00:59:36,963
And the rest of you
will be spared.

460
00:59:38,103 --> 00:59:40,571
Go back to England
and tell them there

461
00:59:40,672 --> 00:59:45,075
that Scotland's daughters
and her sons are yours no more.

462
00:59:47,178 --> 00:59:49,578
Tell them Scotland is free.

463
00:59:55,353 --> 00:59:56,786
Burn it.

464
01:00:31,222 --> 01:00:34,123
The Scottish rebels
have routed

465
01:00:34,225 --> 01:00:36,125
one of my garrisons

466
01:00:36,227 --> 01:00:38,286
and murdered
the noble lord.

467
01:00:38,396 --> 01:00:39,454
I heard.

468
01:00:39,564 --> 01:00:42,032
This Wallace is a brigand,
nothing more.

469
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:45,569
And how would you deal
with this brigand?

470
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:47,137
Like any common thief.

471
01:00:47,238 --> 01:00:49,729
Have the local
magistrate arrest him

472
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:51,138
and punish him
accordingly.

473
01:00:52,677 --> 01:00:54,372
Leave us.

474
01:01:05,523 --> 01:01:08,083
Wallace has already
killed the magistrate

475
01:01:08,193 --> 01:01:10,718
and taken control
of the town.

476
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:13,161
Stand up.

477
01:01:13,264 --> 01:01:14,993
Stand up.

478
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,034
In the morning,

479
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:20,104
I depart for France
to press our rights there,

480
01:01:20,205 --> 01:01:24,835
and I leave you here to
quell this little rebellion.

481
01:01:24,943 --> 01:01:26,604
Understood?
Is it?

482
01:01:26,711 --> 01:01:28,542
Unh!

483
01:01:30,215 --> 01:01:33,013
One day,
you will be a king.

484
01:01:34,986 --> 01:01:38,149
At least
try to act like one.

485
01:01:40,725 --> 01:01:42,283
Get away from me!

486
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:45,261
Convene my military council.

487
01:02:11,256 --> 01:02:12,382
Aah!

488
01:02:27,305 --> 01:02:28,636
There!

489
01:02:31,176 --> 01:02:32,370
After them.

490
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:01,338
No point resisting.

491
01:03:01,439 --> 01:03:02,929
You're outnumbered
and trapped.

492
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:06,340
Now, where are the rest of you?
Where's Wallace?

493
01:03:18,741 --> 01:03:20,040
Father?

494
01:03:20,108 --> 01:03:22,042
Oh, come in.
Come in.

495
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:24,145
A rebellion
has begun.

496
01:03:30,952 --> 01:03:32,886
Under whom?

497
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:34,488
A commoner...

498
01:03:34,589 --> 01:03:36,147
named William Wallace.

499
01:03:46,968 --> 01:03:49,368
You will embrace
this rebellion.

500
01:03:49,504 --> 01:03:52,268
Suppon't it from
our lands in the north.

501
01:03:52,407 --> 01:03:54,272
I will gain
English favor

502
01:03:54,409 --> 01:03:56,843
by condemning it
and ordering it opposed

503
01:03:56,945 --> 01:04:00,278
from our lands
in the south.

504
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:03,282
Sit down.

505
01:04:03,418 --> 01:04:04,885
Stay awhile.

506
01:04:11,426 --> 01:04:12,791
This Wallace...

507
01:04:14,429 --> 01:04:16,795
he doesn't even
have a knighthood,

508
01:04:16,932 --> 01:04:19,400
but he fights
with passion,

509
01:04:19,534 --> 01:04:20,967
and he inspires.

510
01:04:21,102 --> 01:04:26,267
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did, eh?

511
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:27,966
So would I.

512
01:04:28,109 --> 01:04:29,406
Well, maybe it's time.

513
01:04:29,544 --> 01:04:31,136
It is time...

514
01:04:31,279 --> 01:04:32,769
to survive.

515
01:04:32,914 --> 01:04:35,314
You're the 17th
Roben't Bruce.

516
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:39,318
The 16 before you
passed you land and title

517
01:04:39,454 --> 01:04:41,786
because they didn't
charge in.

518
01:04:43,024 --> 01:04:45,492
Call a meeting
of the nobles.

519
01:04:45,594 --> 01:04:47,186
They do nothing
but talk.

520
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:48,318
Rightly so.

521
01:04:48,463 --> 01:04:50,829
They're as rich
in English titles and lands

522
01:04:50,966 --> 01:04:53,764
as they are in Scottish,
just as we are.

523
01:04:53,902 --> 01:04:55,767
You admire this man,
this William Wallace.

524
01:04:55,904 --> 01:04:58,464
Uncompromising men
are easy to admire.

525
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:00,973
He has courage.
So does a dog.

526
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:03,771
But it is exactly
the ability to compromise

527
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:05,641
that makes a man noble.

528
01:05:05,747 --> 01:05:07,772
And understand this...

529
01:05:07,916 --> 01:05:10,783
Edward Longshanks
is the most ruthless king

530
01:05:10,919 --> 01:05:14,286
ever to sit
on the throne of England,

531
01:05:14,422 --> 01:05:17,789
and none of us
and nothing of Scotland

532
01:05:17,926 --> 01:05:20,793
will remain
unless we are as ruthless.

533
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:25,299
Give ear to our nobles.

534
01:05:25,433 --> 01:05:27,298
Knowing their minds

535
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:29,699
is the key
to the throne.

536
01:05:46,554 --> 01:05:47,816
Wait. Wait.

537
01:05:47,956 --> 01:05:48,820
Look.

538
01:05:48,957 --> 01:05:51,824
This is out,
and this is left.

539
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,257
Carry on.

540
01:05:53,395 --> 01:05:54,760
Carry on!

541
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:38,528
You know...

542
01:07:38,666 --> 01:07:40,293
eventually,
Longshanks will send

543
01:07:40,402 --> 01:07:42,962
his whole northern army
against us.

544
01:07:43,104 --> 01:07:44,469
Heavy cavalry,
armored horse...

545
01:07:44,572 --> 01:07:46,005
shake the very ground.

546
01:07:47,142 --> 01:07:49,167
They'll ride
right over us.

547
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:51,801
Uncle Argyle used to
talk about it,

548
01:07:51,913 --> 01:07:55,041
how no army ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

549
01:07:55,183 --> 01:07:56,707
So what do we do?

550
01:07:56,851 --> 01:07:59,411
Hit, run, hide,
the Highland way.

551
01:08:07,395 --> 01:08:08,828
We'll make spears.

552
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:11,760
Hundreds of them.

553
01:08:11,866 --> 01:08:14,858
Long spears...
twice as long as a man.

554
01:08:14,969 --> 01:08:16,630
That long?

555
01:08:16,771 --> 01:08:17,760
Aye.

556
01:08:17,872 --> 01:08:20,238
Some men are longer
than others.

557
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:23,503
Your mother been telling you
stories about me again.

558
01:08:25,947 --> 01:08:28,108
Volunteers coming in!

559
01:08:29,884 --> 01:08:30,816
William Wallace,

560
01:08:30,919 --> 01:08:33,786
we've come to fight
and to die for you.

561
01:08:33,888 --> 01:08:36,823
Stand up, man.
I'm not the pope.

562
01:08:36,925 --> 01:08:39,587
My name is Faudron.
My sword is yours.

563
01:08:39,694 --> 01:08:40,922
I brought you this.

564
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:43,361
We checked them for arms.

565
01:08:43,465 --> 01:08:45,296
I brought you this.

566
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:48,061
My wife made it
for you.

567
01:08:48,203 --> 01:08:49,795
Thank you.

568
01:08:54,309 --> 01:08:56,743
Him? That cart
be William Wallace.

569
01:08:56,845 --> 01:08:58,972
I'm prettier
than this man.

570
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,876
All right, Father.
I'll ask him.

571
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:10,848
If I risk
my neck for you,

572
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:13,018
will I get a chance
to kill Englishmen?

573
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:15,026
Is your father
a ghost,

574
01:09:15,163 --> 01:09:17,597
or do you converse
with the Almighty?

575
01:09:17,732 --> 01:09:20,462
To find his equal,
an Irishman talks to God.

576
01:09:20,568 --> 01:09:23,093
The Almighty says
don't change the subject.

577
01:09:23,238 --> 01:09:24,967
Just answer
the fucking question.

578
01:09:25,073 --> 01:09:26,404
Mind your tongue.

579
01:09:26,508 --> 01:09:27,907
Insane Irish.

580
01:09:31,179 --> 01:09:35,411
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

581
01:09:35,517 --> 01:09:37,485
That's my friend,
Irishman,

582
01:09:37,585 --> 01:09:40,145
and the answer
to your question is yes.

583
01:09:40,255 --> 01:09:43,452
You fight for me,
you get to kill the English.

584
01:09:43,591 --> 01:09:44,523
Excellent!

585
01:09:44,626 --> 01:09:46,025
Stephen is my name.

586
01:09:46,127 --> 01:09:49,028
I'm the most wanted
man on my island,

587
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:52,031
except I'm not on my island,
of course.

588
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:53,532
More's the pity.

589
01:09:53,635 --> 01:09:56,297
Your island?
You mean Ireland?

590
01:09:56,437 --> 01:09:57,904
Yeah. It's mine.

591
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,468
You're a madman.

592
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,770
Ha ha ha!

593
01:10:06,881 --> 01:10:08,371
Ha ha ha!

594
01:10:10,652 --> 01:10:13,746
I've come to
the right place, then.

595
01:11:26,728 --> 01:11:27,717
Aah!

596
01:11:32,967 --> 01:11:36,368
Sure didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

597
01:11:38,506 --> 01:11:40,497
I didn't like him
anyway.

598
01:11:43,778 --> 01:11:45,769
He wasn't right
in the head.

599
01:12:00,061 --> 01:12:01,790
It's several runners!

600
01:12:10,204 --> 01:12:11,296
Hello.

601
01:12:13,107 --> 01:12:16,804
The English are advancing
an army toward Stirling.

602
01:12:16,911 --> 01:12:17,969
Do the nobles
rally?

603
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:19,808
Roben't the Bruce
and most of the others

604
01:12:19,914 --> 01:12:21,245
will not commit
to battle,

605
01:12:21,349 --> 01:12:22,976
but word has spread,

606
01:12:23,084 --> 01:12:25,985
and the Highlanders
are coming down on their own.

607
01:12:26,087 --> 01:12:28,248
In droves of hundreds
and thousands.

608
01:12:28,356 --> 01:12:30,483
Are you ready
for a war?

609
01:12:46,541 --> 01:12:47,508
What news?

610
01:12:47,608 --> 01:12:49,508
We're outnumbered,
at least three to one.

611
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:50,838
How many horse?

612
01:12:50,945 --> 01:12:51,934
300. Maybe more.

613
01:12:52,046 --> 01:12:53,513
300 heavy horse?

614
01:12:53,614 --> 01:12:54,979
We must negotiate.

615
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:56,778
Who's in command?

616
01:12:56,884 --> 01:12:59,284
Did he have
a scarlet chevron?

617
01:12:59,387 --> 01:13:00,786
Aye, he did.

618
01:13:00,888 --> 01:13:02,788
We can still
negotiate.

619
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:08,794
What are they
talking about?

620
01:13:08,896 --> 01:13:12,297
I cart hear,
but it does not look good.

621
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,300
The nobles
will negotiate.

622
01:13:14,402 --> 01:13:16,302
They'll do
a deal,

623
01:13:16,404 --> 01:13:18,304
then we go home.

624
01:13:18,406 --> 01:13:20,601
If not,
we charge.

625
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:22,266
We have no chance.

626
01:14:22,403 --> 01:14:23,734
So many.

627
01:14:28,409 --> 01:14:30,309
I didn't come here
to fight

628
01:14:30,411 --> 01:14:32,311
so they could own
more lands.

629
01:14:32,413 --> 01:14:34,313
Then I'll have to
work for them.

630
01:14:34,415 --> 01:14:35,473
Nor me.

631
01:14:37,084 --> 01:14:39,814
All right, lads!
I'm not dying for these bastards.

632
01:14:39,921 --> 01:14:41,889
Let's go home!

633
01:15:00,408 --> 01:15:03,935
Stop, men!
Do not flee!

634
01:15:04,045 --> 01:15:06,741
Wait until
we've negotiated!

635
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:01,266
William Wallace.

636
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:03,337
Cart be.
Not tall enough.

637
01:16:24,358 --> 01:16:27,122
The Almighty says this must be
a fashionable fight.

638
01:16:27,228 --> 01:16:28,957
It's drawn
the finest people.

639
01:16:29,063 --> 01:16:30,963
Where is thy salute?

640
01:16:31,065 --> 01:16:32,965
For presenting yourselves
on this battlefield,

641
01:16:33,067 --> 01:16:34,432
I give you thanks.

642
01:16:34,535 --> 01:16:35,797
This is our army.

643
01:16:35,903 --> 01:16:37,564
To join it,
you give homage.

644
01:16:37,672 --> 01:16:40,072
I give homage to Scotland,

645
01:16:40,174 --> 01:16:43,735
and if this is your army...

646
01:16:43,844 --> 01:16:45,402
why does it go?

647
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:47,811
We didn't come here
to fight for them!

648
01:16:51,852 --> 01:16:54,252
Home!
The English are too many.

649
01:17:02,697 --> 01:17:05,257
Sons of Scotland...

650
01:17:05,366 --> 01:17:07,891
I am William Wallace.

651
01:17:08,002 --> 01:17:09,765
William Wallace
is 7 feet tall.

652
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,269
Yes. I've heard.

653
01:17:11,372 --> 01:17:13,772
He kills men
by the hundreds,

654
01:17:13,874 --> 01:17:16,775
and if he were here,
he'd consume the English

655
01:17:16,877 --> 01:17:18,777
with fireballs
from his eyes

656
01:17:18,879 --> 01:17:21,040
and bolts of lightning
from his arse.

657
01:17:24,885 --> 01:17:27,786
I am William Wallace...

658
01:17:27,888 --> 01:17:32,291
and I see a whole army
of my countrymen

659
01:17:32,393 --> 01:17:36,625
here in defiance
of tyranny.

660
01:17:38,899 --> 01:17:41,459
You've come to fight
as free men.

661
01:17:43,404 --> 01:17:45,804
And free men you are.

662
01:17:48,409 --> 01:17:50,809
What will you do
with that freedom?

663
01:17:52,847 --> 01:17:54,314
Will you fight?

664
01:17:54,415 --> 01:17:56,651
- No!
- No!

665
01:17:56,652 --> 01:17:57,450
- No!
- No.

666
01:17:57,451 --> 01:17:59,578
Against that?
No!

667
01:17:59,687 --> 01:18:02,918
We will run,
and we will live.

668
01:18:03,024 --> 01:18:04,218
Aye.

669
01:18:04,325 --> 01:18:07,226
Fight, and you may die.

670
01:18:07,328 --> 01:18:10,229
Run, and you'll live...

671
01:18:10,331 --> 01:18:11,958
at least awhile.

672
01:18:14,735 --> 01:18:18,728
And dying in your beds
many years from now,

673
01:18:18,839 --> 01:18:22,366
would you be willing
to trade

674
01:18:22,476 --> 01:18:25,240
all the days
from this day to that

675
01:18:25,346 --> 01:18:28,110
for one chance...
just one chance...

676
01:18:28,215 --> 01:18:31,082
to come back here
and tell our enemies

677
01:18:31,185 --> 01:18:33,745
that they may take
our lives,

678
01:18:33,854 --> 01:18:37,620
but they'll never take
our freedom?

679
01:18:40,194 --> 01:18:43,220
Albagu bra!

680
01:19:04,752 --> 01:19:06,379
They seem quite
optimistic to me.

681
01:19:06,487 --> 01:19:07,954
Maybe they do
want to fight.

682
01:19:08,055 --> 01:19:11,218
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion, milord,

683
01:19:11,325 --> 01:19:12,724
but, nonetheless,

684
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:15,193
I think we should deliver
the king's terms.

685
01:19:15,296 --> 01:19:17,856
The king's terms?
He'll never live up to them.

686
01:19:17,965 --> 01:19:20,331
Milord, I think...

687
01:19:20,434 --> 01:19:22,425
All right.
Offer them the terms.

688
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,837
Shall we go and meet them?

689
01:19:27,942 --> 01:19:30,103
Let me do the talking.

690
01:19:30,211 --> 01:19:31,303
Agreed.

691
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:38,251
Fine speech.

692
01:19:38,352 --> 01:19:40,252
Now what do we do?

693
01:19:41,856 --> 01:19:43,687
Just be yourselves.

694
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:45,850
Where are you going?

695
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,088
I'm going to pick
a fi ght.

696
01:19:49,196 --> 01:19:50,322
Hyah!

697
01:19:55,169 --> 01:19:58,366
Well, we didn't get dressed up
for nothing.

698
01:20:01,175 --> 01:20:03,109
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

699
01:20:07,148 --> 01:20:09,776
Here are
the king's terms...

700
01:20:09,884 --> 01:20:14,480
Lead this army
off the field...

701
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:21,892
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire,

702
01:20:21,996 --> 01:20:23,554
including
hereditary title,

703
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:27,156
from which you will pay...

704
01:20:27,268 --> 01:20:29,202
from which you will pay him
an annual duty...

705
01:20:29,303 --> 01:20:31,271
I have an offer
foryou.

706
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:33,101
Cheltham, this is
William Wallace.

707
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:36,938
From which you will pay
the king an annual duty...

708
01:20:37,044 --> 01:20:38,773
I said I have
an offer foryou.

709
01:20:38,879 --> 01:20:40,346
You disrespect
a banner oftruce?

710
01:20:40,447 --> 01:20:42,244
From his king?
Absolutely.

711
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,318
Here are
Scotland's terms...

712
01:20:45,419 --> 01:20:48,217
Loweryour flags
and march

713
01:20:48,322 --> 01:20:49,721
straight back
to England,

714
01:20:49,824 --> 01:20:51,257
stopping at every home
you pass by

715
01:20:51,358 --> 01:20:52,484
to beg forgiveness

716
01:20:52,593 --> 01:20:54,754
for 100 years oftheft,
rape, and murder.

717
01:20:54,862 --> 01:20:58,093
Do that,
and your men shall live.

718
01:20:58,199 --> 01:21:02,101
Do it not, and every one
of you will die today.

719
01:21:02,203 --> 01:21:04,967
Ha ha ha ha!

720
01:21:08,876 --> 01:21:10,434
You are outmatched.

721
01:21:10,544 --> 01:21:12,774
You have no
heavy cavalry.

722
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,576
In two centuries,
no army has won...

723
01:21:15,683 --> 01:21:17,548
I'm not finished!

724
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:20,777
Before we let you leave,

725
01:21:20,888 --> 01:21:23,584
your commander
must cross that field,

726
01:21:23,691 --> 01:21:26,285
present himself
before this army,

727
01:21:26,393 --> 01:21:28,293
put his head
between his legs,

728
01:21:28,395 --> 01:21:29,885
and kiss his own arse.

729
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,975
I'd say that was rather
less cordial than he's used to.

730
01:21:44,078 --> 01:21:45,773
Be ready and do
exactly as I say.

731
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,404
On my signal,

732
01:21:47,514 --> 01:21:50,540
ride round behind our position
and flank them.

733
01:21:50,651 --> 01:21:52,175
We must not
divide our forces.

734
01:21:52,286 --> 01:21:55,119
Do it, and let the English
see you do it.

735
01:21:55,222 --> 01:21:57,087
They'll think
we run away.

736
01:21:57,191 --> 01:22:01,093
Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.

737
01:22:01,195 --> 01:22:02,253
Right.

738
01:22:02,363 --> 01:22:04,888
Come on.

739
01:22:18,879 --> 01:22:20,779
Hyah!

740
01:22:27,755 --> 01:22:29,279
Insolent bastard.

741
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:32,291
I want this Wallace's
heart on a plate.

742
01:22:32,393 --> 01:22:33,883
Archers.

743
01:22:33,994 --> 01:22:35,825
Archers! Archers!

744
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:37,295
Archers!

745
01:22:41,902 --> 01:22:45,531
Archers, forward!

746
01:23:31,986 --> 01:23:33,920
Aah!

747
01:23:42,229 --> 01:23:43,491
You bastards!

748
01:24:18,032 --> 01:24:19,226
Loose!

749
01:24:38,786 --> 01:24:42,017
The Lord tells me
he can get me out of this mess,

750
01:24:42,122 --> 01:24:44,317
but He's pretty sure
you're fucked.

751
01:24:46,093 --> 01:24:46,991
Ha ha ha!

752
01:24:53,033 --> 01:24:54,022
Aah!

753
01:25:05,512 --> 01:25:06,570
Ready!

754
01:25:06,713 --> 01:25:07,873
Loose!

755
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,065
Ride!

756
01:25:31,238 --> 01:25:33,798
See. Every Scot with a horse
is fleeing.

757
01:25:33,941 --> 01:25:36,705
Our cavalry will ride
them down like grass.

758
01:25:36,844 --> 01:25:38,175
Send the horse.

759
01:25:38,312 --> 01:25:39,870
Full attack.

760
01:26:55,355 --> 01:26:56,913
Steady!

761
01:26:58,358 --> 01:26:59,518
Hold!

762
01:27:01,762 --> 01:27:03,195
Hold!

763
01:27:08,068 --> 01:27:09,000
Hold!

764
01:27:13,707 --> 01:27:14,799
Hold!

765
01:27:26,587 --> 01:27:29,420
Now!

766
01:28:15,202 --> 01:28:16,669
Send the infantry.

767
01:28:16,803 --> 01:28:18,737
You lead them!

768
01:28:36,657 --> 01:28:37,988
Aah!

769
01:30:37,544 --> 01:30:39,603
Retreat!

770
01:30:56,863 --> 01:30:58,455
Aah!

771
01:31:14,347 --> 01:31:16,315
Bastard!

772
01:31:59,459 --> 01:32:00,983
All right.

773
01:32:28,388 --> 01:32:30,288
Aah!

774
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:49,370
Aah!

775
01:32:50,944 --> 01:32:53,139
Wallace! Wallace!

776
01:33:13,767 --> 01:33:17,362
I knight thee
Sire William Wallace.

777
01:33:21,141 --> 01:33:24,042
Sire William,
in the name of God,

778
01:33:24,144 --> 01:33:25,668
we declare
and appoint thee

779
01:33:25,779 --> 01:33:27,508
guardian and high protector
of Scotland

780
01:33:27,614 --> 01:33:31,448
and thy captains
as aides-de-camp.

781
01:33:31,551 --> 01:33:33,678
Stand and be recognized.

782
01:33:43,597 --> 01:33:45,690
Does anyone know
his politics?

783
01:33:45,799 --> 01:33:47,790
No, but his weight
with the commoners

784
01:33:47,901 --> 01:33:50,335
could unbalance
everything.

785
01:33:50,437 --> 01:33:52,530
The Balliols
will kiss his arse,

786
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:53,867
and so we must.

787
01:34:01,815 --> 01:34:03,806
Sire William.

788
01:34:07,253 --> 01:34:08,345
Sire William...

789
01:34:08,455 --> 01:34:11,356
inasmuch as you
and your captains

790
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:13,323
hail from a region

791
01:34:13,426 --> 01:34:16,793
long known to support
the Balliol clan,

792
01:34:16,896 --> 01:34:20,332
may we invite you
to continue your support

793
01:34:20,433 --> 01:34:21,957
and uphold
our rightful claim.

794
01:34:22,068 --> 01:34:24,832
Damn the Balliol clan!

795
01:34:24,938 --> 01:34:27,406
They're all
Longshanks' men!

796
01:34:27,507 --> 01:34:28,496
Gentlemen.

797
01:34:29,609 --> 01:34:31,167
Gentlemen.

798
01:34:31,277 --> 01:34:34,110
Now is the time
to declare a king.

799
01:34:34,214 --> 01:34:37,274
You're prepared to recognize
our legitimate succession?

800
01:34:37,384 --> 01:34:39,443
You're the ones who won't
suppon't the rightful...

801
01:34:39,552 --> 01:34:41,076
Those were lies...

802
01:34:41,187 --> 01:34:43,348
Oh, no.
That's the truth.

803
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:45,686
I demand recognition
of these documents!

804
01:34:45,792 --> 01:34:48,192
These documents were lies
when you wrote them!

805
01:34:49,796 --> 01:34:51,855
Gentlemen, please!
Gentlemen!

806
01:34:51,965 --> 01:34:54,160
Please, gentlemen!

807
01:34:54,267 --> 01:34:58,135
Wait! Sire William,
where are you going?

808
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:01,139
We have beaten
the English,

809
01:35:01,241 --> 01:35:02,970
but they'll come back

810
01:35:03,076 --> 01:35:05,306
because you
won't stand together.

811
01:35:05,412 --> 01:35:07,642
What will you do?

812
01:35:07,747 --> 01:35:09,647
I will invade England

813
01:35:09,749 --> 01:35:12,843
and defeat the English
on their own ground.

814
01:35:12,952 --> 01:35:17,150
Ha ha ha! Invade?
That's impossible.

815
01:35:17,257 --> 01:35:18,155
Why?

816
01:35:18,258 --> 01:35:19,885
Why is that impossible?

817
01:35:19,993 --> 01:35:21,961
You're so concerned
with squabbling

818
01:35:22,062 --> 01:35:24,656
for the scraps
from Longshanks' table

819
01:35:24,764 --> 01:35:28,359
that you've missed
your God-given right

820
01:35:28,468 --> 01:35:29,730
to something better.

821
01:35:29,836 --> 01:35:31,736
There's a difference
between us.

822
01:35:31,838 --> 01:35:33,738
You think the people
of this country exist

823
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,740
to provide you
with position.

824
01:35:35,842 --> 01:35:37,742
I think your
position exists

825
01:35:37,844 --> 01:35:40,677
to provide those people
with freedom,

826
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:45,376
and I go to make sure
that they have it.

827
01:35:57,731 --> 01:35:59,130
Wait!

828
01:36:02,068 --> 01:36:04,036
I respect
what you said,

829
01:36:04,137 --> 01:36:06,002
but remember
that these men

830
01:36:06,106 --> 01:36:07,733
have lands
and castles.

831
01:36:07,841 --> 01:36:09,741
It's much to risk.

832
01:36:09,843 --> 01:36:11,970
The common man that bleeds
on the battlefield...

833
01:36:12,078 --> 01:36:13,511
does he risk less?

834
01:36:17,751 --> 01:36:19,150
No...

835
01:36:19,252 --> 01:36:21,152
but from top to bottom,

836
01:36:21,254 --> 01:36:23,654
this country has got
no sense of itself.

837
01:36:23,757 --> 01:36:26,157
Its nobles share
allegiance with England.

838
01:36:26,259 --> 01:36:28,489
Its clans
war with each other.

839
01:36:28,595 --> 01:36:29,994
Aye.

840
01:36:30,096 --> 01:36:32,656
If you make enemies
on both sides of the border,

841
01:36:32,766 --> 01:36:34,165
you'll end up dead.

842
01:36:34,267 --> 01:36:36,167
We all end up dead.

843
01:36:36,269 --> 01:36:38,499
It's just a question
of how and why.

844
01:36:38,605 --> 01:36:40,402
I want
what you want,

845
01:36:40,507 --> 01:36:42,270
but we need
the nobles.

846
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:43,672
We need them?

847
01:36:43,777 --> 01:36:44,709
Aye.

848
01:36:44,811 --> 01:36:45,835
Nobles.

849
01:36:45,945 --> 01:36:48,641
Tell me, what does that mean...
to be noble?

850
01:36:48,748 --> 01:36:50,306
Your title
gives you claim

851
01:36:50,416 --> 01:36:52,179
to the throne
of our country,

852
01:36:52,285 --> 01:36:54,116
but men
don't follow titles,

853
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:55,653
they follow courage.

854
01:36:55,755 --> 01:36:57,746
Now, our people
know you.

855
01:36:57,857 --> 01:37:00,257
Noble and common...
they respect you,

856
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:04,126
and if you would
just lead them to freedom...

857
01:37:05,732 --> 01:37:07,131
they'd follow you.

858
01:37:09,469 --> 01:37:10,936
And so would I.

859
01:37:33,159 --> 01:37:34,285
Damn it!

860
01:37:34,394 --> 01:37:36,123
My sodomite cousin
the prince tells me

861
01:37:36,229 --> 01:37:38,129
he has no troops
to lend,

862
01:37:38,231 --> 01:37:41,223
and every town in Northern England
is begging for help.

863
01:37:42,569 --> 01:37:43,934
He advances!

864
01:37:44,037 --> 01:37:45,436
To which town?

865
01:37:45,538 --> 01:37:47,301
To here, milord.

866
01:37:47,407 --> 01:37:48,669
Bring the provisions
inside!

867
01:37:48,775 --> 01:37:50,709
Double the wall guards!
Seal the gate! Now!

868
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:51,936
Hyah!

869
01:37:52,045 --> 01:37:54,070
Bring in the provisions!

870
01:38:24,711 --> 01:38:27,305
Sire, we can get you out
if you leave now.

871
01:38:27,413 --> 01:38:29,108
I'm not about
to tell my uncle

872
01:38:29,215 --> 01:38:32,343
I've lost him the greatest city
in Northern England.

873
01:39:12,191 --> 01:39:13,590
Come on!

874
01:39:48,695 --> 01:39:50,356
Make way for the king!

875
01:39:58,805 --> 01:40:01,205
It's not your fault.

876
01:40:01,307 --> 01:40:03,207
Stand up to him!

877
01:40:03,309 --> 01:40:06,210
I will stand up
to him and more.

878
01:40:43,349 --> 01:40:44,976
What news of the north?

879
01:40:46,352 --> 01:40:48,115
Nothing new,
Your Majesty.

880
01:40:48,221 --> 01:40:51,054
We've sent riders
to speed any word.

881
01:40:51,157 --> 01:40:53,557
I heard the word
in France,

882
01:40:53,659 --> 01:40:56,651
where I was fighting
to expand your future kingdom.

883
01:40:56,763 --> 01:40:59,027
The word, my son,

884
01:40:59,132 --> 01:41:04,399
is that our entire
northern army is annihilated...

885
01:41:04,504 --> 01:41:06,836
and you have done nothing.

886
01:41:06,939 --> 01:41:08,839
L- I have ordered
conscriptions.

887
01:41:08,941 --> 01:41:11,705
They're assembled
and ready to depart.

888
01:41:13,579 --> 01:41:17,140
Excuse me, sire, but there's
a very urgent message from York.

889
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:18,649
Come.

890
01:41:26,359 --> 01:41:27,587
Leave us.

891
01:41:27,693 --> 01:41:29,820
Thank you, sire.

892
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:34,358
Uh, W-Wallace has
sacked York.

893
01:41:34,467 --> 01:41:35,559
What?

894
01:41:35,668 --> 01:41:38,159
Wallace has sacked York.

895
01:41:39,338 --> 01:41:40,635
Uh!

896
01:41:42,275 --> 01:41:43,674
Oh.

897
01:41:53,019 --> 01:41:54,486
Sire...

898
01:41:54,587 --> 01:41:56,612
thy own nephew.

899
01:41:56,722 --> 01:41:59,623
What beast could do
such a thing?

900
01:42:01,227 --> 01:42:03,127
If he can sack York...

901
01:42:05,064 --> 01:42:07,464
he can invade
Lower England.

902
01:42:07,567 --> 01:42:09,262
We would stop him!

903
01:42:11,737 --> 01:42:14,900
Who is this person
who speaks to me

904
01:42:15,007 --> 01:42:18,135
as though I needed
his advice?

905
01:42:18,244 --> 01:42:21,236
I have declared Phillip
my high counselor.

906
01:42:21,347 --> 01:42:22,644
Is he qualified?

907
01:42:22,748 --> 01:42:25,478
I am skilled
in the arts of war

908
01:42:25,585 --> 01:42:28,281
and military tactics,
sire.

909
01:42:28,387 --> 01:42:30,651
Are you?

910
01:42:30,756 --> 01:42:33,520
Then tell me...
what advice would you offer

911
01:42:33,626 --> 01:42:37,426
on the, uh,
present, uh,

912
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:38,519
situation?

913
01:42:38,631 --> 01:42:40,895
Aah!

914
01:43:08,227 --> 01:43:11,628
I shall offer a truce...

915
01:43:11,731 --> 01:43:14,131
and buy him off.

916
01:43:15,735 --> 01:43:18,135
But who will go to him?

917
01:43:18,237 --> 01:43:20,137
Not I.

918
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:23,140
If I fell under the sword
of that murderer,

919
01:43:23,242 --> 01:43:26,143
it might be my head
in a basket.

920
01:43:26,245 --> 01:43:30,841
And not my gentle son.

921
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:32,850
The mere sight of him

922
01:43:32,952 --> 01:43:37,150
would only encourage an enemy
to take over the whole country.

923
01:43:38,758 --> 01:43:41,158
So whom do I send?

924
01:43:45,765 --> 01:43:47,892
Whom do I send?

925
01:45:10,349 --> 01:45:11,611
I'm dreaming.

926
01:45:11,717 --> 01:45:13,708
Yes, you are.

927
01:45:15,354 --> 01:45:17,015
And you must wake.

928
01:45:21,861 --> 01:45:23,260
Uh...

929
01:45:26,365 --> 01:45:28,765
I don't want to wake.

930
01:45:28,868 --> 01:45:32,099
I want to stay here
with you.

931
01:45:33,539 --> 01:45:35,769
And I with you...

932
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:37,604
but you must wake now.

933
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:43,280
Wake up, William.

934
01:45:43,382 --> 01:45:44,679
Wake up.

935
01:45:47,453 --> 01:45:49,353
William, wake up,
wake up.

936
01:45:49,455 --> 01:45:50,717
William!

937
01:45:50,823 --> 01:45:53,257
A royal entourage comes!

938
01:45:53,392 --> 01:45:54,791
Flying banners of truce!

939
01:45:54,894 --> 01:45:58,990
And the standards
of Longshanks himself!

940
01:46:41,006 --> 01:46:43,406
I am the princess
of Wales.

941
01:46:43,509 --> 01:46:45,773
I come as
the king's servant

942
01:46:45,878 --> 01:46:47,209
and with
his authority.

943
01:46:47,313 --> 01:46:48,940
To do what?

944
01:46:49,081 --> 01:46:52,073
To discuss
the king's proposals.

945
01:46:54,653 --> 01:46:58,020
Will you speak
with a woman?

946
01:47:16,609 --> 01:47:20,136
I understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight.

947
01:47:20,279 --> 01:47:22,213
I have been given
nothing.

948
01:47:22,348 --> 01:47:24,475
God makes men
what they are.

949
01:47:24,617 --> 01:47:28,348
Did God make you the sacker
of peaceful cities?

950
01:47:28,454 --> 01:47:30,854
The executioner
of the king's nephew,

951
01:47:30,956 --> 01:47:32,753
my husband's own cousin?

952
01:47:32,858 --> 01:47:34,758
York was
the staging point

953
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:37,260
for every invasion
of my country,

954
01:47:37,363 --> 01:47:39,763
and that royal cousin
hanged innocent Scots,

955
01:47:39,865 --> 01:47:42,163
even women and children
from the city walls.

956
01:47:46,372 --> 01:47:48,203
Well, Longshanks
did far worse

957
01:47:48,307 --> 01:47:50,172
the last time he took
a Scottish city.

958
01:48:09,762 --> 01:48:12,196
You ask your king
to his face.

959
01:48:12,331 --> 01:48:13,298
Ask him.

960
01:48:15,534 --> 01:48:19,026
You see if his eyes
can convince you of the truth.

961
01:48:27,346 --> 01:48:29,746
Hamilton, leave us.

962
01:48:31,784 --> 01:48:32,682
Milady...

963
01:48:32,785 --> 01:48:34,514
Leave us. Now.

964
01:48:45,364 --> 01:48:47,696
Let us talk plainly.

965
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:49,199
You invade England,

966
01:48:49,301 --> 01:48:51,701
but you cannot
complete the conquest

967
01:48:51,804 --> 01:48:55,205
so far from your shelter
and supply.

968
01:48:55,307 --> 01:48:57,832
The king desires peace.

969
01:48:57,977 --> 01:49:00,878
Longshanks
desires peace?

970
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:03,210
He declares it to me.
I swear it.

971
01:49:03,315 --> 01:49:06,045
He proposes that
you withdraw your attack.

972
01:49:06,151 --> 01:49:08,176
In return, he grants you
title, estates,

973
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,787
and this chest of gold,

974
01:49:09,922 --> 01:49:11,856
which I am to pay
to you personally.

975
01:49:11,991 --> 01:49:14,221
A lordship and titles...

976
01:49:14,326 --> 01:49:15,725
gold...

977
01:49:15,828 --> 01:49:17,455
that I should become
Judas?

978
01:49:17,596 --> 01:49:19,621
Peace is made
in such ways.

979
01:49:19,765 --> 01:49:21,460
Slaves are made
in such ways!

980
01:49:24,336 --> 01:49:26,736
The last time
Longshanks spoke of peace,

981
01:49:26,839 --> 01:49:28,238
I was a boy,

982
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:29,739
and many
Scottish nobles,

983
01:49:29,842 --> 01:49:31,241
who would not be slaves,

984
01:49:31,343 --> 01:49:33,743
were lured by him,
under a flag of truce,

985
01:49:33,846 --> 01:49:36,246
to a barn... where
he had them hanged.

986
01:49:37,950 --> 01:49:39,349
I was very young,

987
01:49:39,451 --> 01:49:42,852
but I remember
Longshanks' notion of peace.

988
01:49:46,125 --> 01:49:48,719
I understand
you have suffered.

989
01:49:50,362 --> 01:49:53,763
I know... about your woman.

990
01:50:04,376 --> 01:50:06,276
She was my wife.

991
01:50:08,881 --> 01:50:10,781
We married in secret

992
01:50:10,883 --> 01:50:14,785
because I would not share her
with an English lord.

993
01:50:14,887 --> 01:50:18,323
They killed her...
to get to me.

994
01:50:23,395 --> 01:50:26,296
I have never
spoken of it.

995
01:50:26,398 --> 01:50:29,299
I don't know why
I tell you now,

996
01:50:29,401 --> 01:50:30,800
except...

997
01:50:32,404 --> 01:50:34,531
I see her strength
in you.

998
01:50:40,913 --> 01:50:44,815
One day,
you'll be a queen...

999
01:50:44,917 --> 01:50:47,351
And you must
open your eyes.

1000
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:57,761
You tell your king
that William Wallace

1001
01:50:57,863 --> 01:50:59,763
will not be ruled...

1002
01:50:59,865 --> 01:51:02,698
and nor will any Scot
while I live.

1003
01:51:36,252 --> 01:51:38,652
Ah, my son's
loyal wife returns

1004
01:51:38,755 --> 01:51:40,655
unkilled
by the heathen.

1005
01:51:40,757 --> 01:51:43,191
So he accepted
our bribe?

1006
01:51:43,293 --> 01:51:45,318
No, he did not.

1007
01:51:45,428 --> 01:51:47,589
Then why does he stay?

1008
01:51:47,697 --> 01:51:52,031
My scouts tell me that
he has not advanced.

1009
01:51:52,135 --> 01:51:54,103
He waits for you at York.

1010
01:51:54,204 --> 01:51:57,105
He says he will attack
no more towns or cities

1011
01:51:57,207 --> 01:51:59,368
if you are man enough
to come and face him.

1012
01:51:59,476 --> 01:52:02,138
Did he?

1013
01:52:02,245 --> 01:52:06,614
The Welsh bowmen
will not be detected

1014
01:52:06,716 --> 01:52:10,117
arriving so far
around his flank.

1015
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:13,121
The main force
of our armies from France

1016
01:52:13,223 --> 01:52:14,690
will land here

1017
01:52:14,791 --> 01:52:16,691
to the north of Edinburgh.

1018
01:52:16,793 --> 01:52:21,628
Conscripts from Ireland will
approach from the southwest...

1019
01:52:21,731 --> 01:52:23,130
to here.

1020
01:52:23,233 --> 01:52:25,633
Welsh bowmen? Troops from France?
Irish conscripts?

1021
01:52:25,735 --> 01:52:27,635
Even if you
dispatch them today,

1022
01:52:27,737 --> 01:52:29,500
they'd take weeks
to assemble.

1023
01:52:29,606 --> 01:52:33,838
I dispatched them
before I sent your wife.

1024
01:52:38,248 --> 01:52:40,614
So our little ruse
succeeded.

1025
01:52:40,717 --> 01:52:42,742
Thank you.

1026
01:52:42,852 --> 01:52:44,251
And while
this upstart

1027
01:52:44,354 --> 01:52:46,083
awaits my arrival
in York,

1028
01:52:46,189 --> 01:52:51,126
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh behind him.

1029
01:52:51,227 --> 01:52:58,895
You spoke with this,
uh, Wallace in private.

1030
01:52:59,002 --> 01:53:01,402
Tell me...

1031
01:53:01,504 --> 01:53:04,268
what kind of man
is he?

1032
01:53:04,374 --> 01:53:08,105
A mindless barbarian.

1033
01:53:08,211 --> 01:53:11,203
Not a king like you,
milord.

1034
01:53:13,716 --> 01:53:16,116
You may return
to your embroidery.

1035
01:53:16,219 --> 01:53:17,618
Humbly, milord.

1036
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:21,087
You brought back the money,
of course.

1037
01:53:24,727 --> 01:53:27,127
No. I gave it
to ease the suffering

1038
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:29,790
of the children
of this war.

1039
01:53:32,368 --> 01:53:34,598
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

1040
01:53:36,739 --> 01:53:38,138
Forgive me, sire.

1041
01:53:38,241 --> 01:53:39,640
I thought that generosity

1042
01:53:39,742 --> 01:53:41,141
might demonstrate
your greatness

1043
01:53:41,244 --> 01:53:44,077
to those
you mean to rule.

1044
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,647
Ahem.

1045
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:50,583
My greatness will be
better demonstrated

1046
01:53:50,687 --> 01:53:53,520
when Wallace
returns to Scotland

1047
01:53:53,623 --> 01:53:56,592
and finds his country
in ashes.

1048
01:54:00,863 --> 01:54:02,091
William!

1049
01:54:02,198 --> 01:54:04,098
There's riders
approaching!

1050
01:54:10,406 --> 01:54:14,604
Personal escort
of the princess.

1051
01:54:14,711 --> 01:54:16,110
Aye.

1052
01:54:17,547 --> 01:54:19,276
Must have made
an impression.

1053
01:54:19,382 --> 01:54:20,610
Aye.

1054
01:54:20,717 --> 01:54:23,618
I didn't think you were
in the tent that long.

1055
01:54:27,724 --> 01:54:29,055
Mademoiselle.

1056
01:54:30,727 --> 01:54:33,355
Un message
de ma maitresse.

1057
01:54:33,463 --> 01:54:35,124
Merci.

1058
01:54:59,689 --> 01:55:02,920
It's true! English ships
are moving up from the south!

1059
01:55:03,026 --> 01:55:04,493
I don't know about
the Welsh yet,

1060
01:55:04,594 --> 01:55:06,494
but the Irish
have landed!

1061
01:55:06,596 --> 01:55:09,588
I had to see it
before I could believe it.

1062
01:55:09,699 --> 01:55:11,564
Why are the Irish
fighting with the English?

1063
01:55:11,668 --> 01:55:13,693
I wouldn't worry
about them.

1064
01:55:13,803 --> 01:55:17,569
Didn't I tell you before?
It's my island.

1065
01:55:17,674 --> 01:55:19,574
Hamish, ride ahead
to Edinburgh

1066
01:55:19,676 --> 01:55:20,768
and assemble
the council.

1067
01:55:20,877 --> 01:55:21,901
Order it.

1068
01:55:22,011 --> 01:55:22,909
Aye.

1069
01:55:23,012 --> 01:55:24,536
Hup!

1070
01:55:24,647 --> 01:55:25,807
Hyah!

1071
01:55:27,183 --> 01:55:28,616
Your island?

1072
01:55:28,718 --> 01:55:31,778
My island! Yup!

1073
01:55:31,888 --> 01:55:33,287
You want to negotiate?

1074
01:55:33,389 --> 01:55:34,549
No, please,
gentlemen!

1075
01:55:34,657 --> 01:55:37,023
Lords,
Craig is right!

1076
01:55:37,126 --> 01:55:38,889
This time
our only option

1077
01:55:38,995 --> 01:55:41,225
is to negotiate.

1078
01:55:41,331 --> 01:55:43,799
Unless you want to see Edinburgh
razed to the ground...

1079
01:55:49,672 --> 01:55:52,072
My army has marched
for more days

1080
01:55:52,175 --> 01:55:53,369
than I can remember,

1081
01:55:53,476 --> 01:55:55,842
and we still have
preparations to make,

1082
01:55:55,945 --> 01:55:58,072
so I'll make this plain.

1083
01:55:58,181 --> 01:56:01,582
We require every soldier
you can summon...

1084
01:56:01,684 --> 01:56:04,551
your personal escorts,
even yourselves...

1085
01:56:04,654 --> 01:56:06,349
and we need them now.

1086
01:56:08,191 --> 01:56:10,091
With such a force
arrayed against us,

1087
01:56:10,193 --> 01:56:11,922
it's time to discuss
other options.

1088
01:56:12,028 --> 01:56:13,586
Other options?

1089
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:17,097
Don't you wish at least
to lead your men

1090
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:18,599
onto the field

1091
01:56:18,701 --> 01:56:21,101
and barter a better deal
with Longshanks

1092
01:56:21,204 --> 01:56:23,001
before you tuck tail
and run?

1093
01:56:23,106 --> 01:56:24,004
Sire William...

1094
01:56:24,107 --> 01:56:25,335
We cart defeat
this army!

1095
01:56:25,441 --> 01:56:26,567
We can!

1096
01:56:26,676 --> 01:56:28,234
And we will!

1097
01:56:30,713 --> 01:56:34,444
We won at Stirling...
and still you quibble!

1098
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:37,610
We won at York,
and you would not support us.

1099
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:40,120
If you'll not
stand up with us now,

1100
01:56:40,223 --> 01:56:41,622
then I say
you're cowards.

1101
01:56:46,929 --> 01:56:49,557
And if you're Scotsmen,

1102
01:56:49,665 --> 01:56:52,065
I'm ashamed
to call myself one.

1103
01:56:52,168 --> 01:56:54,728
Please, Sire William,
speak with me alone.

1104
01:56:57,673 --> 01:56:59,038
I beg you.

1105
01:57:02,178 --> 01:57:05,079
Now, you've achieved more
than anyone ever dreamed,

1106
01:57:05,181 --> 01:57:06,580
but fighting
these odds,

1107
01:57:06,682 --> 01:57:09,082
it looks like rage,
not courage.

1108
01:57:09,185 --> 01:57:10,652
It's well beyond rage.

1109
01:57:12,688 --> 01:57:14,155
Help me.

1110
01:57:15,892 --> 01:57:20,056
In the name of Christ,
help yourselves!

1111
01:57:20,163 --> 01:57:22,063
Now is our chance. Now.

1112
01:57:22,165 --> 01:57:24,395
If we join, we can win.

1113
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:28,596
If we win, we'll have
what none of us ever had before...

1114
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:30,103
a country of our own.

1115
01:57:32,208 --> 01:57:34,301
You're the rightful leader.

1116
01:57:34,410 --> 01:57:37,174
And there is strength in you,
I see it.

1117
01:57:42,351 --> 01:57:43,340
Unite us.

1118
01:57:46,055 --> 01:57:47,545
Unite us!

1119
01:57:47,657 --> 01:57:49,420
Unite the clans.

1120
01:57:56,699 --> 01:57:58,064
All right.

1121
01:57:58,167 --> 01:57:59,566
Right.

1122
01:58:04,173 --> 01:58:06,334
This cannot be the way.

1123
01:58:06,442 --> 01:58:08,603
You said yourself...

1124
01:58:08,711 --> 01:58:13,080
the nobles will not
support Wallace.

1125
01:58:13,182 --> 01:58:15,082
So how did it help us

1126
01:58:15,184 --> 01:58:18,085
to join the side
that is slaughtered?

1127
01:58:18,187 --> 01:58:20,087
I gave him my word.

1128
01:58:28,197 --> 01:58:30,597
I know it is hard.

1129
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:32,861
Being a leader is.

1130
01:58:34,504 --> 01:58:38,600
But, son... son...

1131
01:58:38,708 --> 01:58:40,073
look at me.

1132
01:58:47,383 --> 01:58:49,044
I cannot be king.

1133
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:52,609
You and you alone
can rule Scotland.

1134
01:58:52,722 --> 01:58:55,623
What I tell you,
you must do.

1135
01:58:55,725 --> 01:58:58,558
Not for me,
not for yourself,

1136
01:58:58,661 --> 01:59:00,561
for your country.

1137
01:59:16,646 --> 01:59:18,045
Eh, lads, make way.

1138
01:59:18,147 --> 01:59:20,047
Coming through here.

1139
01:59:26,656 --> 01:59:28,055
Make way, lads.

1140
01:59:28,157 --> 01:59:29,556
Make...

1141
01:59:33,663 --> 01:59:36,223
The Bruce is
not coming, William.

1142
01:59:36,332 --> 01:59:38,027
He'll come.

1143
01:59:40,002 --> 01:59:42,368
Mornay and Lochlan
have come.

1144
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:45,567
So will the Bruce.

1145
01:59:48,444 --> 01:59:53,074
Quite the lovely...
gathering.

1146
01:59:53,182 --> 01:59:54,911
Wouldn't you agree?

1147
01:59:57,920 --> 01:59:59,945
The archers
are ready, sire.

1148
02:00:00,056 --> 02:00:01,455
Not the archers.

1149
02:00:01,557 --> 02:00:04,958
My scouts tell me
their archers are miles away

1150
02:00:05,061 --> 02:00:06,961
and no threat to us.

1151
02:00:07,063 --> 02:00:09,429
Arrows cost money.
Use up the Irish.

1152
02:00:09,532 --> 02:00:10,726
The dead cost nothing.

1153
02:00:10,833 --> 02:00:13,927
And send in
the infantry and cavalry.

1154
02:00:14,036 --> 02:00:15,435
Infantry!

1155
02:00:15,538 --> 02:00:16,470
Infantry!

1156
02:00:16,572 --> 02:00:17,470
Cavalry!

1157
02:00:17,573 --> 02:00:18,597
Cavalry!

1158
02:00:18,708 --> 02:00:20,107
Cavalry!

1159
02:00:20,209 --> 02:00:21,540
Cavalry!

1160
02:00:21,644 --> 02:00:22,804
Advance!

1161
02:00:22,912 --> 02:00:24,971
Advance!

1162
02:01:48,130 --> 02:01:52,123
Ah, good to see you
this morning!

1163
02:01:53,469 --> 02:01:56,131
Irish.

1164
02:01:56,238 --> 02:01:58,638
Glad to
have you with us.

1165
02:01:58,741 --> 02:02:00,072
Watch this.

1166
02:04:09,839 --> 02:04:12,569
Mornay? Lochlan?

1167
02:04:12,675 --> 02:04:15,473
I gave Mornay double
his lands in Scotland

1168
02:04:15,578 --> 02:04:17,569
and matching estates
in England.

1169
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:21,081
Lochlan turned
for much less.

1170
02:04:21,183 --> 02:04:22,582
Archers.

1171
02:04:22,685 --> 02:04:24,084
I beg pardon, sire.

1172
02:04:24,186 --> 02:04:26,279
Won't we hit
our own troops?

1173
02:04:28,691 --> 02:04:30,090
Yes...

1174
02:04:30,192 --> 02:04:32,023
but we'll hit theirs
as well.

1175
02:04:32,127 --> 02:04:34,789
We have reserves.

1176
02:04:34,897 --> 02:04:36,364
Attack.

1177
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:39,292
Archers!

1178
02:04:39,401 --> 02:04:42,302
Archers... attack!

1179
02:04:47,309 --> 02:04:48,298
Loose!

1180
02:04:55,217 --> 02:04:56,741
Loose!

1181
02:05:17,273 --> 02:05:18,672
Send in our reinforcements.

1182
02:05:20,075 --> 02:05:21,133
Send in the rest!

1183
02:05:31,587 --> 02:05:34,579
Bring me Wallace.

1184
02:05:34,690 --> 02:05:36,590
Alive, if possible.

1185
02:05:36,692 --> 02:05:38,592
Dead... just as good.

1186
02:05:38,694 --> 02:05:41,254
Send us news
of our victory.

1187
02:05:41,363 --> 02:05:43,297
Shall we retire?

1188
02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:10,008
Protect the king.

1189
02:09:13,909 --> 02:09:15,137
Get up!

1190
02:09:15,244 --> 02:09:16,711
Get up!

1191
02:09:18,147 --> 02:09:19,705
Up!

1192
02:09:19,815 --> 02:09:21,043
Get up!

1193
02:09:22,117 --> 02:09:23,880
Get him out of here!

1194
02:09:28,724 --> 02:09:30,282
Go!

1195
02:10:30,352 --> 02:10:31,683
I'm dying.

1196
02:10:35,857 --> 02:10:37,154
Let me be.

1197
02:10:43,198 --> 02:10:45,098
No.

1198
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:48,397
You're going to live.

1199
02:10:48,503 --> 02:10:52,200
I've lived long enough
to live free.

1200
02:10:52,307 --> 02:10:58,041
Proud to see you become
the man you are.

1201
02:11:02,651 --> 02:11:04,676
I'm a happy man.

1202
02:12:53,595 --> 02:12:56,530
I'm the one
who's rotting,

1203
02:12:56,631 --> 02:13:00,397
but I think your face
looks graver than mine.

1204
02:13:05,107 --> 02:13:06,540
Son...

1205
02:13:12,114 --> 02:13:14,514
we must have alliance
with England

1206
02:13:14,616 --> 02:13:16,743
to prevail here.

1207
02:13:16,852 --> 02:13:19,013
You achieved that.

1208
02:13:19,121 --> 02:13:20,520
You saved your family,

1209
02:13:20,622 --> 02:13:23,250
increased your land.

1210
02:13:23,358 --> 02:13:28,386
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

1211
02:13:28,497 --> 02:13:34,063
Lands, titles,
men, power... nothing.

1212
02:13:34,770 --> 02:13:35,896
Nothing?

1213
02:13:36,004 --> 02:13:37,562
I have nothing.

1214
02:13:39,007 --> 02:13:40,406
Men fight for me...

1215
02:13:40,509 --> 02:13:43,535
because if they do not,
I throw them off my land

1216
02:13:43,645 --> 02:13:46,944
and I starve their wives
and their children.

1217
02:13:47,048 --> 02:13:52,953
Those men who bled
the ground red at Falkirk...

1218
02:13:53,088 --> 02:13:54,988
they fought for
William Wallace,

1219
02:13:55,090 --> 02:13:58,787
and he fights for
something that I've never had.

1220
02:14:00,462 --> 02:14:04,364
And I took it from him
when I betrayed him,

1221
02:14:04,466 --> 02:14:08,368
and I saw it in his face
on the battlefield,

1222
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:10,370
and it's tearing me apart!

1223
02:14:10,472 --> 02:14:13,669
Well, all men betray,
all lose heart.

1224
02:14:13,775 --> 02:14:16,471
I don't want
to lose heart!

1225
02:14:19,614 --> 02:14:24,813
I want to believe...
as he does.

1226
02:14:30,625 --> 02:14:34,026
I will never be
on the wrong side again.

1227
02:15:23,645 --> 02:15:25,545
No!

1228
02:15:51,239 --> 02:15:52,797
There he is!
After him!

1229
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:25,067
Lord Craig,
is it true about Mornay?

1230
02:16:25,173 --> 02:16:30,133
Aye. Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

1231
02:16:30,278 --> 02:16:33,179
More a liability now
than ever he was.

1232
02:16:33,281 --> 02:16:36,512
And there's no telling
who'll be next.

1233
02:16:38,119 --> 02:16:39,643
Maybe you.

1234
02:16:41,856 --> 02:16:43,323
Maybe me.

1235
02:16:49,064 --> 02:16:50,827
It doesn't matter.

1236
02:16:52,734 --> 02:16:54,133
I'm serious, Robert.

1237
02:16:54,235 --> 02:16:55,634
So am I!

1238
02:17:08,984 --> 02:17:10,884
Christ! Shit!

1239
02:17:10,986 --> 02:17:13,648
Search the place!

1240
02:17:16,558 --> 02:17:17,650
Lochlan.

1241
02:17:24,699 --> 02:17:27,497
William Wallace
killed 50 men.

1242
02:17:27,602 --> 02:17:30,002
50 if it was one.

1243
02:17:30,105 --> 02:17:31,231
100 men...

1244
02:17:31,339 --> 02:17:32,738
with his own sword.

1245
02:17:32,841 --> 02:17:34,638
Cut through them like...

1246
02:17:34,743 --> 02:17:37,906
Moses through
the Red Sea.

1247
02:18:10,078 --> 02:18:12,672
His legend grows.

1248
02:18:12,781 --> 02:18:15,511
It will be worse
than before.

1249
02:18:15,617 --> 02:18:18,518
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town,

1250
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:20,485
and when he replenishes
his numbers...

1251
02:18:20,588 --> 02:18:23,022
They're sheep!
Mere sheep!

1252
02:18:24,759 --> 02:18:28,195
Easily dispersed
if we strike the shepherd.

1253
02:18:28,329 --> 02:18:29,990
Very well.

1254
02:18:30,098 --> 02:18:33,499
Pick a flock
of your finest assassins

1255
02:18:33,601 --> 02:18:35,000
and set a meeting.

1256
02:18:35,103 --> 02:18:38,334
Milord, Wallace
is renowned

1257
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:41,000
for his ability
to smell an ambush.

1258
02:18:43,611 --> 02:18:47,445
If what Lord Hamilton tells me
is correct,

1259
02:18:47,549 --> 02:18:49,449
he warmed to
our future queen.

1260
02:18:49,551 --> 02:18:51,348
He would trust her.

1261
02:18:53,021 --> 02:18:55,285
So we'll dispatch her
with the notion

1262
02:18:55,390 --> 02:18:56,687
that she comes in peace.

1263
02:18:56,791 --> 02:18:59,555
Milord, the princess
might be taken hostage

1264
02:18:59,661 --> 02:19:01,959
or her life
be put in jeopardy.

1265
02:19:02,063 --> 02:19:05,624
Oh, my son would be
most distressed by that.

1266
02:19:05,734 --> 02:19:09,329
Uh, but in truth,
if she were to be killed,

1267
02:19:09,437 --> 02:19:13,237
we would soon find
the king of France

1268
02:19:13,341 --> 02:19:15,502
a useful ally
against the Scots.

1269
02:19:17,278 --> 02:19:20,475
You see, as king,

1270
02:19:20,582 --> 02:19:25,542
you must find the good
in any situation.

1271
02:19:51,646 --> 02:19:54,342
It's William Wallace, sure.

1272
02:19:54,482 --> 02:19:57,280
He's giving up his sword.

1273
02:19:57,385 --> 02:19:58,317
Be ready.

1274
02:20:21,910 --> 02:20:24,174
Aah!

1275
02:21:37,085 --> 02:21:38,484
Milady...

1276
02:21:43,091 --> 02:21:45,059
I received your message.

1277
02:21:45,193 --> 02:21:46,854
Oh.

1278
02:21:58,106 --> 02:22:00,506
This is...
the second time

1279
02:22:00,608 --> 02:22:02,235
you've warned me
of danger.

1280
02:22:04,712 --> 02:22:06,111
Why?

1281
02:22:06,214 --> 02:22:09,012
There will be
a new shipment of supplies

1282
02:22:09,117 --> 02:22:12,143
coming north next month...
foods and weapons.

1283
02:22:12,287 --> 02:22:15,484
No, stop.

1284
02:22:15,623 --> 02:22:17,784
Why do you help me?

1285
02:22:23,631 --> 02:22:27,032
Why do you help me?

1286
02:22:27,168 --> 02:22:30,968
Because of the way
you are looking at me now.

1287
02:24:22,483 --> 02:24:24,974
Just when we thought
all hope was lost,

1288
02:24:25,119 --> 02:24:27,952
our noble saviors
have arrived.

1289
02:24:30,058 --> 02:24:32,458
Off with their... hoods.

1290
02:24:37,565 --> 02:24:40,227
Sire William, we've come
to seek a meeting.

1291
02:24:40,368 --> 02:24:42,928
Well, what's the point?

1292
02:24:43,071 --> 02:24:45,266
You've all sworn loyalty
to Longshanks.

1293
02:24:45,406 --> 02:24:47,966
An oath to a liar
is no oath at all.

1294
02:24:48,109 --> 02:24:50,805
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1295
02:24:50,945 --> 02:24:53,004
So let the council
swear publicly.

1296
02:24:53,147 --> 02:24:56,981
We cannot. Some scarcely
believe you're alive.

1297
02:24:57,085 --> 02:24:59,485
Others think you'll pay
them Mornay's wages.

1298
02:24:59,587 --> 02:25:01,452
So we bid you
to Edinburgh.

1299
02:25:01,556 --> 02:25:02,989
Meet us two days
from now.

1300
02:25:03,091 --> 02:25:05,491
Pledge us your pardon,
and we'll unite behind you.

1301
02:25:05,593 --> 02:25:06,992
Scotland will be one.

1302
02:25:07,095 --> 02:25:09,393
One?
You mean us and you.

1303
02:25:09,497 --> 02:25:12,193
No.

1304
02:25:12,333 --> 02:25:14,028
I mean this.

1305
02:25:16,437 --> 02:25:18,735
It's the pledge
of Robert the Bruce.

1306
02:25:28,449 --> 02:25:30,440
You do know it's a trap.
Tell him.

1307
02:25:30,585 --> 02:25:32,450
If the Bruce
wanted to kill you,

1308
02:25:32,553 --> 02:25:33,986
he'd have done it
at Falkirk.

1309
02:25:34,122 --> 02:25:35,180
Aye.

1310
02:25:35,323 --> 02:25:37,985
I know. I saw.

1311
02:25:38,126 --> 02:25:40,458
Leave him aside.
What about the others?

1312
02:25:40,561 --> 02:25:42,153
Nest of scheming bastards!

1313
02:25:42,296 --> 02:25:44,423
They couldn't agree
on the color of shite!

1314
02:25:44,565 --> 02:25:46,089
It's a trap.
Are you blind?

1315
02:25:46,234 --> 02:25:48,429
Look at us.

1316
02:25:48,569 --> 02:25:50,469
We've got to try.

1317
02:25:50,571 --> 02:25:52,971
We cart do
this alone.

1318
02:25:53,074 --> 02:25:55,474
Joining the nobles
is the only hope for our people.

1319
02:25:55,576 --> 02:25:58,067
You know what happens
if we don't take that chance?

1320
02:25:58,212 --> 02:25:59,270
What?

1321
02:25:59,413 --> 02:26:00,437
Nothing.

1322
02:26:02,517 --> 02:26:04,951
I don't want
to be a martyr.

1323
02:26:05,086 --> 02:26:06,986
Nor I.
I want to live.

1324
02:26:07,088 --> 02:26:09,989
I want a home
and children and peace.

1325
02:26:10,091 --> 02:26:11,854
Do you?

1326
02:26:11,959 --> 02:26:13,449
Aye, I do.

1327
02:26:13,594 --> 02:26:15,494
I've asked God
for those things.

1328
02:26:15,596 --> 02:26:17,791
It's all for nothing
if you don't have freedom.

1329
02:26:17,932 --> 02:26:20,162
That's just
a dream, William.

1330
02:26:20,268 --> 02:26:21,963
A dream?
Just a...

1331
02:26:22,103 --> 02:26:25,937
Well, then what have we
been doing all this time?

1332
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:27,667
We've lived that dream.

1333
02:26:27,808 --> 02:26:29,901
Your dream
isn't about freedom.

1334
02:26:30,044 --> 02:26:31,568
It's about Murron.

1335
02:26:31,712 --> 02:26:35,045
Your dream is to be a hero
'cause you think she sees you.

1336
02:26:35,149 --> 02:26:38,380
I don't think she sees me.
I know she does.

1337
02:26:38,486 --> 02:26:40,351
And your father
sees you, too.

1338
02:26:42,023 --> 02:26:43,786
Ohh!

1339
02:26:46,394 --> 02:26:47,918
Ah.

1340
02:26:50,731 --> 02:26:53,461
Jesus.

1341
02:26:53,601 --> 02:26:56,968
Get up.
Give us your hand.

1342
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:00,803
Shall I come with you?

1343
02:27:03,044 --> 02:27:06,104
No. I'll go alone.

1344
02:27:06,247 --> 02:27:09,148
I'll see you after.

1345
02:27:09,250 --> 02:27:10,740
Right.

1346
02:27:15,056 --> 02:27:18,548
Sooner rather
than later, I hope.

1347
02:27:24,565 --> 02:27:25,896
He won't come.

1348
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,399
He will.

1349
02:27:27,501 --> 02:27:29,401
I know he will.

1350
02:27:42,516 --> 02:27:45,417
Milord,
he approaches!

1351
02:28:29,830 --> 02:28:31,764
No!

1352
02:28:36,604 --> 02:28:38,401
Stay out of it,
Robert!

1353
02:28:38,506 --> 02:28:41,737
Aah!
You lied! You lied!

1354
02:28:45,513 --> 02:28:48,744
Bruce is not to be hurt!
That's the arrangement!

1355
02:28:56,524 --> 02:28:58,014
Father!

1356
02:29:04,165 --> 02:29:06,998
You rotting bastard!

1357
02:29:07,101 --> 02:29:10,434
Why? Why?

1358
02:29:14,041 --> 02:29:17,442
Longshanks
acquired Wallace.

1359
02:29:17,545 --> 02:29:19,069
So did our nobles.

1360
02:29:19,213 --> 02:29:21,909
That was the price
of your crown.

1361
02:29:22,049 --> 02:29:25,450
Die!

1362
02:29:25,553 --> 02:29:27,111
I want you to die!

1363
02:29:27,254 --> 02:29:32,021
Soon enough I'll be dead,
and you'll be king.

1364
02:29:32,126 --> 02:29:34,959
I don't want
anything from you.

1365
02:29:35,062 --> 02:29:37,462
You're not a man!

1366
02:29:37,565 --> 02:29:39,260
You're not my father.

1367
02:29:43,571 --> 02:29:48,099
You're my son,
and you've always known my mind.

1368
02:29:48,242 --> 02:29:51,541
You deceived me.

1369
02:29:51,645 --> 02:29:53,545
You let yourself
be deceived.

1370
02:29:53,647 --> 02:29:58,482
In your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.

1371
02:30:01,088 --> 02:30:04,546
Thus, you know what
it means to hate.

1372
02:30:09,597 --> 02:30:11,997
Now you're ready
to be a king.

1373
02:30:12,099 --> 02:30:17,696
My hate will die...
with you.

1374
02:30:22,109 --> 02:30:24,509
William Wallace,

1375
02:30:24,612 --> 02:30:27,274
you stand in taint
of high treason.

1376
02:30:27,415 --> 02:30:29,610
Against whom?

1377
02:30:29,750 --> 02:30:32,412
Against your king.

1378
02:30:32,553 --> 02:30:34,487
Have you
anything to say?

1379
02:30:34,622 --> 02:30:39,457
Never in my whole life...

1380
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:41,790
did I swear
allegiance to him.

1381
02:30:41,929 --> 02:30:46,263
It matters not.
He is your king.

1382
02:30:48,469 --> 02:30:51,927
Confess, and you may
receive a quick death.

1383
02:30:52,072 --> 02:30:55,564
Deny, and you must
be purified by pain.

1384
02:30:55,709 --> 02:30:58,610
Do you confess?

1385
02:30:58,712 --> 02:31:02,478
Do you confess?

1386
02:31:08,088 --> 02:31:09,988
Then on the morrow,

1387
02:31:10,090 --> 02:31:11,717
you shall receive
your purification.

1388
02:31:23,604 --> 02:31:25,003
Your Highness.

1389
02:31:25,105 --> 02:31:26,436
I will see the prisoner.

1390
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:28,440
We've got orders
from the king...

1391
02:31:28,542 --> 02:31:30,442
The king will be
dead in a month.

1392
02:31:30,544 --> 02:31:31,943
His son
is a weakling.

1393
02:31:32,046 --> 02:31:33,946
Who do you think
will rule this kingdom?

1394
02:31:34,048 --> 02:31:35,447
Now open this door.

1395
02:31:35,549 --> 02:31:37,949
Majesty.

1396
02:31:44,124 --> 02:31:46,115
Come on, filth.
Up on your feet.

1397
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:47,625
Stop it!

1398
02:31:47,728 --> 02:31:50,128
Leave me.

1399
02:31:50,231 --> 02:31:52,426
I said, leave me!

1400
02:32:04,578 --> 02:32:06,512
Milady.

1401
02:32:06,614 --> 02:32:12,484
Sire, I come
to beg you...

1402
02:32:14,088 --> 02:32:16,989
to confess all
and swear allegiance to the king

1403
02:32:17,091 --> 02:32:19,025
that he might
show you mercy.

1404
02:32:19,159 --> 02:32:21,787
Will he show mercy
to my country?

1405
02:32:21,929 --> 02:32:24,955
Mercy is
to die quickly,

1406
02:32:25,099 --> 02:32:27,932
perhaps even
live in a tower.

1407
02:32:28,035 --> 02:32:30,936
In time, who knows
what can happen...

1408
02:32:31,038 --> 02:32:33,097
if you can only live?

1409
02:32:38,045 --> 02:32:40,946
If I swear to him,

1410
02:32:41,048 --> 02:32:44,211
then all that I am
is dead already.

1411
02:32:53,561 --> 02:32:55,927
You will die.
It will be awful.

1412
02:32:56,030 --> 02:32:57,964
Every man dies.

1413
02:33:00,568 --> 02:33:02,399
Not every man really lives.

1414
02:33:09,743 --> 02:33:11,438
Drink this.

1415
02:33:11,579 --> 02:33:13,979
It will dull
your pain.

1416
02:33:14,081 --> 02:33:16,811
No. It will numb
my wits.

1417
02:33:16,951 --> 02:33:19,442
I must have them all.

1418
02:33:19,587 --> 02:33:21,487
For if I'm senseless,
or if I wail,

1419
02:33:21,589 --> 02:33:24,990
then Longshanks
will have broken me.

1420
02:33:25,092 --> 02:33:27,925
I cart bear the thought
of your torture.

1421
02:33:28,028 --> 02:33:29,552
Take it.

1422
02:33:34,401 --> 02:33:35,891
All right.

1423
02:34:22,883 --> 02:34:28,344
I have come to beg
for the life of William Wallace.

1424
02:34:28,455 --> 02:34:32,585
You're quite taken
with him, aren't you?

1425
02:34:32,693 --> 02:34:34,524
I respect him.

1426
02:34:36,964 --> 02:34:39,194
At worst,
he was a worthy enemy.

1427
02:34:39,299 --> 02:34:41,096
Show mercy,
O thou great king,

1428
02:34:41,201 --> 02:34:43,362
and win the respect
of your own people.

1429
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:58,543
Even now...
you are incapable of mercy.

1430
02:35:04,491 --> 02:35:05,890
And you...

1431
02:35:10,497 --> 02:35:13,591
To you, that word is
as unfamiliar as love.

1432
02:35:13,701 --> 02:35:16,397
Before he lost
his powers of speech,

1433
02:35:16,503 --> 02:35:18,903
he told me his
one comfort was that

1434
02:35:19,006 --> 02:35:21,236
he would live to know
Wallace was dead.

1435
02:35:40,461 --> 02:35:43,362
You see...

1436
02:35:43,464 --> 02:35:45,864
death comes to us all.

1437
02:35:55,209 --> 02:35:58,872
But before
it comes to you,

1438
02:35:58,979 --> 02:36:01,379
know this...

1439
02:36:01,482 --> 02:36:05,384
Your blood dies with you.

1440
02:36:05,486 --> 02:36:09,388
A child who is not of your line
grows in my belly.

1441
02:36:12,493 --> 02:36:16,088
Your son will not sit long
on the throne, I swear it.

1442
02:36:53,467 --> 02:36:55,367
I'm so afraid.

1443
02:37:03,477 --> 02:37:07,880
Give me the strength...
to die well.

1444
02:37:31,438 --> 02:37:34,134
Here he comes!

1445
02:39:01,995 --> 02:39:05,294
Now behold
the awful price of treason!

1446
02:39:12,472 --> 02:39:14,235
You will fall
to your knees now.

1447
02:39:16,310 --> 02:39:19,871
Declare yourself
the king's loyal subject

1448
02:39:19,980 --> 02:39:22,574
and beg his mercy.

1449
02:39:29,489 --> 02:39:30,888
And you shall have it.

1450
02:39:41,501 --> 02:39:43,230
Rope!

1451
02:40:06,393 --> 02:40:07,655
Stretch him!

1452
02:40:10,030 --> 02:40:12,863
That's it!
Stretch him!

1453
02:40:28,582 --> 02:40:30,379
Shame! Shame!

1454
02:40:50,604 --> 02:40:52,765
Pleasant... yes?

1455
02:40:55,542 --> 02:40:56,941
Rise to your knees,

1456
02:40:57,044 --> 02:41:00,912
kiss the royal emblem
on my cloak,

1457
02:41:01,014 --> 02:41:02,572
and you will feel
no more.

1458
02:41:44,491 --> 02:41:46,425
Rack him!

1459
02:42:28,435 --> 02:42:29,868
Ahh.

1460
02:42:40,447 --> 02:42:41,846
Enough?

1461
02:42:50,590 --> 02:42:52,319
Ohh.

1462
02:43:34,935 --> 02:43:38,336
It can all end
right now.

1463
02:43:38,438 --> 02:43:39,928
Peace.

1464
02:43:43,944 --> 02:43:45,502
Just say it.

1465
02:43:45,645 --> 02:43:49,513
Cry out... mercy.

1466
02:43:59,459 --> 02:44:00,892
Mercy!

1467
02:44:00,994 --> 02:44:04,395
- Mercy!
- Mercy!

1468
02:44:09,002 --> 02:44:10,026
Cry out.

1469
02:44:10,170 --> 02:44:13,264
- Mercy!
- Mercy!

1470
02:44:16,843 --> 02:44:18,037
Just say it...

1471
02:44:18,178 --> 02:44:20,703
mercy.

1472
02:44:20,847 --> 02:44:23,941
- Mercy!
- Mercy!

1473
02:44:43,203 --> 02:44:45,296
Mercy, William.

1474
02:44:45,438 --> 02:44:48,271
Mercy.
Jesus, now say it.

1475
02:44:54,114 --> 02:44:57,515
The prisoner wishes
to say a word.

1476
02:44:57,651 --> 02:45:00,142
- Mercy!
- Mercy!

1477
02:45:00,287 --> 02:45:02,152
Mercy!

1478
02:45:17,470 --> 02:45:26,742
Freeeedoooom!

1479
02:47:11,651 --> 02:47:15,314
After the beheading,

1480
02:47:15,455 --> 02:47:19,357
William Wallace's body
was torn to pieces.

1481
02:47:21,461 --> 02:47:24,362
His head was set
on London Bridge,

1482
02:47:24,464 --> 02:47:31,302
his arms and legs sent
to the four corners of Britain

1483
02:47:31,404 --> 02:47:33,304
as a warning.

1484
02:47:33,406 --> 02:47:38,309
It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.

1485
02:47:38,411 --> 02:47:42,814
Andl... Robert the Bruce...

1486
02:47:42,916 --> 02:47:48,081
rode out topay homage to
the armies of the English king

1487
02:47:48,221 --> 02:47:51,452
and accept
his endorsement of my crown.

1488
02:47:51,558 --> 02:47:54,049
I hope you've washed
your arse this morning.

1489
02:47:54,194 --> 02:47:57,925
It's about to be
kissed by a king.

1490
02:48:26,092 --> 02:48:29,255
Come. Let's get it over with.

1491
02:48:40,406 --> 02:48:41,771
Stop!

1492
02:48:59,926 --> 02:49:02,258
You have bled
with Wallace!

1493
02:49:08,935 --> 02:49:10,402
Now bleed with me.

1494
02:49:12,472 --> 02:49:14,406
Oh...

1495
02:49:27,287 --> 02:49:32,452
Aah!

1496
02:49:51,144 --> 02:49:53,738
Wallace! Wallace!

1497
02:49:53,880 --> 02:49:54,869
Wallace!

1498
02:49:55,014 --> 02:49:55,981
Wallace!

1499
02:49:56,115 --> 02:49:57,104
Wallace!

1500
02:49:57,250 --> 02:49:59,184
Wallace!

1501
02:50:18,004 --> 02:50:20,905
In the year of our Lord, 1314,

1502
02:50:21,007 --> 02:50:24,909
patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered,

1503
02:50:25,011 --> 02:50:29,345
charged the fields
of Bannockburn.

1504
02:50:29,449 --> 02:50:32,350
They fought like warrior poets,

1505
02:50:32,452 --> 02:50:35,353
they fought like Scotsmen...

1506
02:50:35,455 --> 02:50:37,355
and won their freedom
